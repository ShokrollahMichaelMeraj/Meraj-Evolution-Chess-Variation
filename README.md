# Meraj-Evolution-Chess-Variation
I have always loved chess and have been playing it for years now, recently I had the idea of a chess variation where the pawns have promotion rules to them which brings us here. The Meraj Evolution Chess is a Chess variation in which pawns are no longer identical units. Each pawn is now a unique promotion path, determines at the start state, or through the pawn capture history. Promotions are no longer unristricted , now reflecting the pawns actions and identity.
